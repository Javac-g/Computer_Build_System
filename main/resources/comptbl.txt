The compatibility between the motherboard, RAM, CPU, GPU, and hard drive in a computer depends on several factors:

Motherboard: The motherboard should be compatible with the CPU socket type,
RAM type and speed, and GPU slot type.
The motherboard should also have enough SATA connectors to support the number of hard drives that you want to connect.

RAM: The RAM should be compatible with the motherboard's RAM slot type and speed.
 The RAM should also match the CPU's memory specifications.

CPU: The CPU should be compatible with the motherboard's socket type and chipset.
The CPU's power requirements should also be supported by the motherboard's power delivery system.

GPU: The GPU should be compatible with the motherboard's PCIe slot type and power supply.
 The power supply should have enough power and the right connectors to support the GPU.

Hard drive: The hard drive should be compatible with the motherboard's SATA interface and the power supply's connectors.
 The power supply should also have enough power to support all the components in the system.

It's important to check the compatibility of these components before purchasing them to ensure that
 they will work together properly. The motherboard's manual and specifications are usually a good resource to check for compatibility information

Determine the CPU socket type and select a compatible motherboard
Choose compatible RAM based on the motherboard's supported RAM type and speed
Select a compatible GPU based on the motherboard's available PCIe slots and power supply wattage
Choose a hard drive or SSD that is compatible with the motherboard's storage interfaces (e.g. SATA or NVMe)
Ensure that the power supply unit (PSU) is compatible with the other components and has enough wattage to support the system's power requirements.
