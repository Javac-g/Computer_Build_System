This is my graduation university project.
The porpose of my project is to create a informational system, which can calculate prise of assembling custom pc and configure components compatibility.<br>
I divided my project on few stages.<br>

<br>
2)Create algorythm to divide compartible components.
3)Filter results by (purpose,price)
4)Create web interface.I decided to use thymeleaf wrapper.Its faster than JSP and more clear.(And many other benefits)
