### Personal computer assembly system.
This is my graduation university project.<br>

The porpose of my project is to create a informational system, which can calculate prise of assembling custom pc and configure components compatibility.<br>

I divided my project on few stages.<br>

1)Create database architecture and fill csv with suitable components list.I have choose best on the market.(CPU,GPU,MotherBoard,Storage,RAm)
<br>

2)Create algorythm to divide compartible components.<br>

3)Filter results by (purpose,price)<br>

4)Create web interface.I decided to use thymeleaf wrapper.Its faster than JSP and more clear.(And many other benefits)<br>
